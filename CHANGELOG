0.5.8
 - fix: explicit import of urllib.request to fetch BHFIELD binary
 - build: migrate to GitHub Actions
 - tests: setup.py test is deprecated
 - docs: refurbish docs
 - ref: fix numpy deprecation warnings for np.int
0.5.7
 - setup: bump qpimage from 0.4.0 to 0.6.1
0.5.6
 - maintenance release
0.5.5
 - enh: introduce NegativeRadiusError to detect bad model
   parameters for the rytov-sc model
0.5.4
 - enh: introduce UnsupportedModelParametersError to detect bad model
   paramters for the rytov-sc model
0.5.3
 - fix: also guess initial values for image method if edge detection
   is ill-defined (RadiusExceedsImageSizeError)
 - fix: constrict the position of the center to the image area when
   performing a circle fit to an edge
0.5.2
 - fix: guess initial values for image method when edge detection
   method fails
0.5.1
 - maintenance release
0.5.0
 - feat: allow to select focusing position for rytov, mie, and mie-avg
0.4.0
 - feat: add convenience methods for computing the background
   phase mask using the location of the fitted sphere
0.3.0
 - BREAKING CHANGE in `qpsphere.imagefit.alg.match_phase`:
   The keyword argument `verbose_out_prefix` has been replaced
   by `verbose_h5path`. The dependency on matplotlib (and
   the creation of many PNG files) has been removed in favor
   of a single hdf5 file that allows to retrace the fitting
   procedure.
 - fix: `max_iter` was actually `max_iter + 1`
   in imagefit.alg.match_phase
 - tests: improve coverage
 - docs: minor improvements
0.2.7
 - maintenance release to test automated deploy to PyPI
0.2.0
 - drop support for Python 3.5
 - feat: integer grid_size allowed for square-shaped simulation
 - ref: introduce RadiusExceedsImageSizeError in contour detection
 - code cleanup
0.1.5
 - BREAKING CHANGE: `models.available` is now a list, use
   `models.model_dict` instead.
0.1.4
 - BREAKING CHANGE: replace space " " by dash "-" in model names
 - feat: added methods to handle third party binaries (#3)
 - feat: implemented `ret_qpi` for edge detection in `analyze`
 - fix: example "cell_edge.py" was broken 
0.1.3
 - feat: added 2D phase fitting algorithm (method='image')
 - feat: added Mie average, Rytov, and Rytov-SC models
0.1.2
 - feat: added Mie model (based on BHFIELD) (#1)
 - fix: updated default keyword arguments for sphere models
0.1.1
 - feat: added projection model
 - feat: minor additions to API
0.1.0
 - initial release
