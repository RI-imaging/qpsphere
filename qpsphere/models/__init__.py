    Parameters
    ----------
    radius: float
        Radius of the sphere [m]
    sphere_index: float
        Refractive index of the object
    medium_index: float
        Refractive index of the surrounding medium
    wavelength: float
        Vacuum wavelength of the imaging light [m]
    grid_size: tuple of floats
        Resulting image size in x and y [px]
    model: str
        Sphere model to use (see :const:`available`)
    pixel_size: float or None
        Pixel size [m]; if set to `None` the pixel size is
        chosen such that the radius fits at least three to
        four times into the grid.
    center: tuple of floats or None
        Center position in image coordinates [px]; if set to
        None, the center of the image (grid_size - 1)/2 is
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    qpi: qpimage.QPImage
        Quantitative phase data set
